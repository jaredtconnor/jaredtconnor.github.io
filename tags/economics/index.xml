      <description>I feel fairly comfortable stating that this is my favorite podcast of the year. Nearly anything that Tyler Cowen touches is filled to the Brim with nuggets of insight, but this piece takes the cake for being the most comprehensive categorization of his thoughts on moral philosophy, economics, how one should order themselves in the current economy and so on.
It seems fitting that Robin Wiblin would be the person to incite such a conversation.</description>

      <title>Predict Economics Indicators with OpenStreetMap</title>

      <description>This was a really cool article regarding the use of OpenStreeMap to predict the economic potential and output of a country. Specifically he is using publicly labeled tags and indicators of schools, universities, lamp posts, and post offices to see how much production and economic activity is coming from a specific region!
This could be of great use for economic research in countries where reliable data is a problem or to view competitive economies from a bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view (no pun intended).</description>
