      <description>Welcome! Well it&amp;rsquo;s awesome to see that you&amp;rsquo;ve found it here. After quite some time, I finally was able to publish this via Hugo. That was a headache in itself because Github pages and Hugo don&amp;rsquo;t play nicely with each other, but nonetheless.
So this site is going to hold basically everything I&amp;rsquo;m working on and want everyone to see. Publishing content is a great thing to do in the age where your website/blog basically is your new business card.</description>
