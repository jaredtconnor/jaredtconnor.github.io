This was a really cool article regarding the use of [OpenStreeMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) to predict the economic potential
and output of a country. Specifically he is using publically labeled tags and indicators
of schools, universities, lamp posts, and post offices to see how much production and
economic activity is coming from a specific region!

This could be of great use for economic research in countries where reliable data is a problem
or to view competative economies from a bird's eye view (_no pun intended_)
