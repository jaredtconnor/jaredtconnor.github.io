      <description>This was a really cool article regarding the use of OpenStreeMap to predict the economic potential and output of a country. Specifically he is using publically labeled tags and indicators of schools, universities, lamp posts, and post offices to see how much production and economic activity is coming from a specific region!
This could be of great use for economic research in countries where reliable data is a problem or to view competative economies from a bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view (no pun intended)</description>

      <description>Welcome! Well it&amp;rsquo;s awesome to see that you&amp;rsquo;ve found it here. After quite some time, I finally was able to publish this via Hugo. That was a headache in itself because Github pages and Hugo don&amp;rsquo;t play nicely with each other, but nonetheless.
So this site is going to hold basically everything I&amp;rsquo;m working on and want everyone to see. Publishing content is a great thing to do in the age where your website/blog basically is your new business card.</description>
