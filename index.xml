      <description>I read this wonderful analysis, originally posted by Zippia)on the dynamics of salaries across age and labor demographics, via the PUMS (Public Use Microdata Sample) for you acronym junkies out there. While they attempted to view so called dead end jobs, which they roughly define as jobs that lack little wage growth later in their lives, the analysis illustrates a developing trend - the gradual widening of the high skill/high wage labor and low skill/low wage/service oriented labor.</description>

      <title>Predict Economics Indicators with OpenStreetMap</title>

      <description>This was a really cool article regarding the use of OpenStreeMap to predict the economic potential and output of a country. Specifically he is using publicly labeled tags and indicators of schools, universities, lamp posts, and post offices to see how much production and economic activity is coming from a specific region!
This could be of great use for economic research in countries where reliable data is a problem or to view competitive economies from a bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view (no pun intended).</description>

      <description>Suppose you are a doctor. Someone rolls into your operating room. Say that the nurse who was carrying their packet of info got sidetracked by the latest episode of Game of Thrones. Again, to further simplify our reality, say they are green in the face. From your substantive experience as a doctor you know their condition could be caused by exactly three things: a stroke, a drug overdose, or cancer.</description>

      <description>Welcome! Well it&amp;rsquo;s awesome to see that you&amp;rsquo;ve found it here. After quite some time, I finally was able to publish this via Hugo. That was a headache in itself because Github pages and Hugo don&amp;rsquo;t play nicely with each other, but nonetheless.
So this site is going to hold basically everything I&amp;rsquo;m working on and want everyone to see. Publishing content is a great thing to do in the age where your website/blog basically is your new business card.</description>
